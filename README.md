# Flight Delay Prediction and Analysis

## Overview

This project represents ML analysis of airline delays using the U.S. Department of Transportation's Airline On-Time Statistics and Delay Causes dataset. The project core idea is to predict high-delay periods (months with >25% delay rate) and provides insights for airline operations.

**Student ID:** 16395

## Dataset

The dataset contains **409,612 flight records** from 2003 to 2025, covering domestic flights operated by major U.S. carriers. The dataset includes:

- **Flight Operations**: Total arrivals, cancellations, diversions
- **Delay Causes**: Air Carrier, Weather, National Aviation System, Late Aircraft, Security delays
- **Temporal Information**: Year and month
- **Location Data**: Carrier codes, carrier names, airport codes, airport names
- **Delay Metrics**: Count and duration of delays by cause

## Project Objectives

1. **Predictive Modeling**: Classify months with high delay rates (>25%) vs. normal operations
2. **Data Exploration**: Identify patterns and factors contributing to flight delays
3. **Model Comparison**: Evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful predictors from raw data
5. **Deployment**: Interactive Streamlit application for exploration and prediction

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher #3.11.11 version were used while developing
- pip package manager

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone or download the project**

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Ensure dataset is in place**
   - The dataset file `Airline_Delay_Cause.csv` should be in the `data/` directory

## Usage

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open the notebook**
   - Navigate to `flight_delay_analysis_16395.ipynb`
   - Run cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis

   **Note**: If you encounter an XGBoost error on macOS like:
   ```
   XGBoostError: XGBoost Library (libxgboost.dylib) could not be loaded.
   Likely causes:
     * OpenMP runtime is not installed
       - vcomp140.dll or libgomp-1.dll for Windows
       - libomp.dylib for Mac OSX
       - libgomp.so for Linux and other UNIX-like OSes
     Mac OSX users: Run brew install libomp to install OpenMP runtime.
     * You are running 32-bit Python on a 64-bit OS
   ```
   
   Install the OpenMP runtime using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install libomp
   ```
   
   Then reinstall XGBoost:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip uninstall xgboost
   pip install xgboost
   ```
